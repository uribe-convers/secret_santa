# Secret Santa Generator

Code to play Secret Santa. 

It also includes a Jupyter notebook to make things easier! 

## Instructions

Input a list of names below with the people who will be playing Secret Santa.  
You can include each person's address after their name, separated by a space, `@`, and a space. For example `["Batman @ The Batcave", "The Penguin @ The Iceberg Lounge", "Robin @ The Circus", "Mr. Freeze @ Gotham Mercy Hospital"]`.  
The addresses are handy to have in case you are copy/pasting the output to emails or Slack messages.  

It prints out a table at the end in case that's useful!
